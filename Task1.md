As discussed in class -  there are several heuristic approaches to this rather gnarly problem.

If you begin with requirements, then explore possible pathways, you may design a solution for testing, that may evolve and grow.

Though I asked you to hold off on building the code on the first day, I think it's important to study a problem, from multiple angles to see/explore how you might create a general map of where to go, what tools you should take and how to begin to plan out the smaller steps.

(Imagine you want to plan a vacation - where would you like to go?... and how will you get there?... might be bigger questions at first, then smaller details may come into play as you decide what's important (is the destination the most important, or the stops along the way - that, along with budget may define HOW you'll get to your destingation (airplane, train, car, etc). Do you have a fixed schedule?  How long do you have for the vacation?  Where would you like to stay? (Is this camping or hotel kind or trip - will you stay with family)

Let's take the same approach here - think about what are the key elements?  what are the musts? and what are the negotiables?

First - load in the choice data, and make sure you can work with the raw elements - to start - let's do two tasks - 

1.  Load and print the 2D array that will give you an idea of popularity (for now a 2D array of ints will be fine - each student ID and their five choices (don't foret to skip the first row of the data and print the 'choice table'.

2. Tally up how many students chose each of the sessions - again for now - use the simple 2D array of ints and a loop or series of loops to create an array that displays the total number of students requesting each session (for now, we'll ignore choice/rank.

Be sure to save/commit changes to gitHub frequently

If needed - create a testing class for these steps, if you think your approach will be different - you may refer to the code, but for now - just make sure you can load the data, print it, then calculate tallies and print that.

SUBMISSION - upload the working hyperlink of your Github repo and a screenshot or two showing your program running the outpusts of the two tasks above. (Name, comments, and don't overbuild this task (you may work in other methods/classes - but keep these first two tasks isolated)
