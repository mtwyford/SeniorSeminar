# SeniorSeminar
A student project for Managing Scheduling and Optimizing a Solution that reduces conflicts

## Develop a Java Based Solution to Minimize Scheduling Conflicts

The attached CSV/Spreadsheet file is the result of sending out a google form and having students enter their top 5 ranked choices, using the mini table in the spreadsheet that contains the sessions, IDs and speakers.

**Feel free to clean up the spreadsheets, and even create new ones if needed, HOWEVER - you many not alter student preferences in the fiel or spreadsheet.

- 5 Time Slots 
- 5 Classrooms (16 students max/ class)
- Sessions Cannot Run more than Twice
- Notice that some sessions are taught by same person
- Student May Not Repeat a Session
- Schedule a Student for 5 Session

**Goal is to design and code an algorithm that generates a schedule for the students, given structure above, with the fewest number of conflicts

- Generate a schedule for the sessions and speakers, 
- Create lists for each student so they know what sessions to attend, rooms and times.
